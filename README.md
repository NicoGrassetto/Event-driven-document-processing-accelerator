# Event Driven Document Processing Accelerator

## Features

This accelerator helps simplify the extraction of information from documents.

The solution includes:

- An end-to-end pipeline triggered by the upload of documents to a blob storage
- Flexible configuration to customize schemas
- Easy integration with other architectures (just upload the document to the blob storage). Output binding can be easily swapped for your desired source

> You can also try Azure AI Content Understanding via the Azure AI Foundry UI for quick experimentation before deploying this template to your own Azure subscription.
