# Event Driven Document Processing Accelerator
Welcome to the Event Driven Document Processing solution accelerator. It's a lightweight template to extract information from documents. This solution accelerator uses Azure Azure AI Content Understanding and Azure Functions.

The Azure voice live API is a solution enabling low-latency, high-quality speech to speech interactions for voice agents. The API is designed for developers seeking scalable and efficient voice-driven experiences as it eliminates the need to manually orchestrate multiple components. By integrating speech recognition, generative AI, and text to speech functionalities into a single, unified interface, it provides an end-to-end solution for creating seamless experiences.

The Azure Communication Services Calls Automation APIs provide telephony integration and real-time event triggers to perform actions based on custom business logic specific to their domain. Within the call automation APIs developers can use simple AI powered APIs, which can be used to play personalized greeting messages, recognize conversational voice inputs to gather information on contextual questions to drive a more self-service model with customers, use sentiment analysis to improve customer service overall.

## Features

This accelerator helps simplify the extraction of information from documents.

The solution includes:

- An end-to-end pipeline triggered by the upload of documents to a blob storage
- Flexible configuration to customize schemas
- Easy integration with other architectures (just upload the document to the blob storage). Output binding can be easily swapped for your desired source

> You can also try Azure AI Content Understanding via the Azure AI Foundry UI for quick experimentation before deploying this template to your own Azure subscription.
